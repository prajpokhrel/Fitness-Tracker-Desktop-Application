# Fitness Tracker/Weight Tracker

• Java OOP • Factory Design Pattern • Java Swing • JDBC • JCharts •

Losing weight is difficult, but it’s made less so by paying careful attention to progress. Studies show that keeping a daily diary of caloric intake and minutes spent exercising can help explain patterns of fluctuating weight observed on a daily basis. By charting this against a daily record of weight and waist-size, motivation can be maintained over the long term.
However, doing this requires a considerable amount of day to day book-keeping. So, I have designed and implemented a system capable of tracking this information and providing useful analysis for users. This desktop-based application consists of the following features:

• It allows users to add and modify their names, age, and gender. </br>
• It allows users to enter a name, portion size in grams, and calorie value for every individual meal they consume. </br>
• It allows the user to enter a type of exercise, calorie value, and how many minutes they undertook of that exercise. </br>
• It allows the user to enter a weight reading at two points in the day – morning and evening. </br>
• It allows the user to enter a waist size at two points in the day – morning and evening. </br>
• It allows the user to set an average activity level for the day, which is set between inactive, moderately active, and active. </br>
• It allows the user to record waist size and weight on a 2x daily basis. </br>
• It calculates the caloric value per gram, and per minute, for meals and exercises. </br>
• It calculates the weight loss for a specified period based on entered data. </br>
• It calculates the total weight change between the start and end of the specific period. </br>
• It generates a line chart that shows the weight each day of the specified period and generates a trend line for that graph. </br>
• It shows the values for caloric intake, burn and difference for each day. </br>
• Calculation of calorie intake necessary to maintain. </br>
